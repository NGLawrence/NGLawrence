- 👋 Hi, I’m @NGLawrence, or Nick Lawrence, BS in CS and currently software engineer.

- 👀 I’m interested in development of applications from APIs to data collection and everything in between. I work with Ruby on Rails and Python, 
     as well as OOD languages like C++ and Java.
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different design approaches to development, and looking to expand upon skills I've acquired both in school
     and professionally.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects that deal with data gathering, manipulation, and displaying, or anything that will help
     refresh and reinvigorate the developer in me.
