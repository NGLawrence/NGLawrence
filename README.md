- 👋 Hi, I’m @NGLawrence, or Nick Lawrence, BS in CS and currently software engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different design approaches to development, and looking to expand upon skills I've acquired both in school and professionally.

- 🔨 Professionally, I am working full stack with a Ruby on Rails application. Personally invested in several projects, from applications to simple helpers.
     
- 👀 I’m interested in development of applications from APIs to data collection and everything in between. I am professionally focused on application development in Ruby on Rails. I'm also interested in contributing to open source and increasing my involvement in the open source community.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects that deal with data gathering, manipulation, and displaying or anything that will help add increase my skills in my toolset or add new ones.
